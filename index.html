    <h1>Vinay Kumar</h1>
    <h3>The Legend of 15th June</h3>
    <h3>Died on 17 November 2021</h3>
    <p>
      My father, Vinay Kumar, was not just a man of discipline and strength, but also a soul deeply passionate about coding. 
      He believed in the power of technology to transform lives and solve real-world problems. His dedication to learning 
      and creating inspired everyone around him. Though he left us on 17th November 2021, his dream did not die. I have taken 
      it upon myself to honor his memory by continuing the journey he once began. Every line of code I write is a tribute 
      to his legacy, and I strive each day to grow, learn, and become someone he would be proud of. However, I cannot remember his famous quote,
      so here's mine: <strong>"Coding is not just a skill, it's a way to change the world by your skill."</strong> I carry his will with me, learning and getting better at it every day. 
      By the way, this is the CSS code I wrote years ago with him and I still use it in almost every HTML file I create.
    </p>

          alert(message);
        } else {
